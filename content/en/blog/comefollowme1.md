![Come, Follow Me journal cover](/img/blogs/come-follow-me/cfm-cover-optimized.png)

2019 marks a big change in the way that members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints attend church and study the gospel. With the switch to a 2-hour meeting block, individuals and families have an exciting chance to study more at home.

This journal supports your personal or family home-centered plan for gospel learning and worship. In conjunction with Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families, weekly gospel study topics are listed. These home study topics coordinate with the Come, Follow Me lessons that classes and quorums will study in Sunday meetings.

Each week lists the scriptures and topics to study. Along the bottom of each week’s pages are study aids and prompts you can ponder as you study. These ideas are provided to help you improve your personal or family scripture study, but are just a sampling of the many things you can focus on. You can take notes, record impressions, doodle scenes from the scriptures, or anything else you feel inspired to do. Each week’s pages are left open so you have the freedom to use them as you want.

## Journals with a Dot Grid interior

These journals have a simple interior with a dot grid. Each spread of two pages is designed to give you a space to record your personal and/or family study for each week. The week's topic is listed at the top left and study prompts on the bottom right.
